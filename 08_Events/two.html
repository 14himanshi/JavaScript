        // As soon as this function is called it will go outside and comes back again using event queue
        // clearInterval, clearTimeout are parts of setTimeout and setInterval only
        // what does this setTimeout() requires: handler (it is a callback function only(a function that does not has name)) and timeout (which is always in milliseconds)

        // setInterval function: it will do a certen function again and again in some specified interval

        // what if we want to stop that timeout function? we will use this clearTimeout function
        // this function needs the refernce of the setTimeout, as there can be many setTimeout functions it needs to now which timeout function it has to clear
